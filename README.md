## Objectives

Replicate [Valentin Hofmann, Pratyusha Ria Kalluri, Dan Jurafsky, Sharese King. 2024. Dialect prejudice predicts AI decisions about people's character, employability, and criminality. On arXiv.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742)

[Requirements](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qzhyQkgqmuYo8k0Ie3q_xLzo9c1aGykxgPPZyaL4b5g/edit?slide=id.g37ba8565e88_0_433#slide=id.g37ba8565e88_0_433)

The replication requries 3 deliverables:

### 1. A project plan

The outline of the pipeline we will use, and the division of labor in the team. This will be graded on completion.

### 2. A github repository

All of the code and files we used for our replication paper. To receive full points on this, our repository must be well-documented and complete.  

### 3. A conference style paper
